  <h2>Background</h2>
<p>Leicester City Supporters' Club (London Branch) was founded prior to the 1977-78 
	  season and covers primarily London and its 
	  bordering counties.</p>
	<h2>Travel</h2>
	<p>The core activity of the club used to be centred around travelling together to home and away matches. However for most journeys by train now group travel is less of a saving so most supporters are now making their own arrangements. However if you would like to meet to travel together please get in touch.
    </p>
	<h2>Social</h2>
	<p>The club has a darts team and we play against London Branches of other Supporters'
	Clubs. In 2014-15 we won the cup and were second in the league.
    </p>
	<h2>Contacting the <br>
  London Foxes</h2>
	<p>If you are interested in joining the branch or travelling with us please contact <br>
