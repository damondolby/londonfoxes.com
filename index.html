  <h2>Background</h2>
	<p>Leicester City Supporters' Club (London Branch) was founded prior to the 1977-78 
	  season and covers primarily London and its 
	  bordering counties.</p>
	<h2>Travel</h2>
	<p>The core activity of the club is centred round travelling together to home and away matches. Most journeys are by train with discounted trips being organised outside the Network South East region. A fast train to Leicester takes just over an hour (hopefully) from London St Pancras. The fare for 2016-17 is £38.00 return – including a reserved seat. This is a flexible off-peak ticket and no payment is required if a match date or time is moved.
    </p>
	<h2>Social</h2>
	<p>The club has a darts team and we play against London Branches of other Supporters'
	Clubs. In 2014-15 we won the cup and were second in the league.
    </p>
